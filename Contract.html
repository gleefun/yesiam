    <p>The contracting of the SERVICES offered by 公司名称 will only be carried out through the APPS, therefore, it can be carried out by the USER who has downloaded and used the APPS that are available for free in Google Play Store (Android) and Apple Store (iOS) (hereinafter "app stores") which can also be accessed through the various links available on the website (公司官网).</p>
    <p>The USER declares to be over 18 years of age and to have the legal capacity to enter into contracts through the APPS. Please, if you detect or become aware that a minor has contracted any of the services offered on the APPS, please notify us at the following email 公司邮箱 as soon as possible so that we can take the appropriate measures.</p>

In case of disagreement between the text of these conditions and any translation of the same, the English version will prevail in any case.</p>

    <h2>Object Of The Contract</h2>
    <p>The purpose of this contract is to regulate the contractual relationship between 公司名称 and the USER and/or conditions of contracting the SERVICES, from the moment the latter accepts during the online contracting process by checking the corresponding box.</p>
    <p>The contractual relationship entails the delivery and/or access, in exchange for a determined price and publicly displayed through the APPS and the app stores, of the SERVICES available in the APPS, namely, but not limited to:</p>
    <p>Sending and accessing, via the application, daily affirmations ("APP名称")</p>

    <h2>Who is a user and/or consumer?</h2>
    <p>The contracting of the SERVICES can be carried out by any natural person after downloading the APPS through the Google Play Store (Android) or App Store (iOS).</p>
    <p>These conditions shall apply to the USER, as well as the conditions that each of the application stores have and all those related to the regulations for the defence and protection of consumers and USERS.</p>

    <h2>Contracting procedure. How to contract?</h2>
    <p>In order to contract the SERVICES offered in the APPS, the USER must be of legal age and register in one of the application stores where the APPS are available (Google Play Store or App Store).</p>
    <p>The USER may then use the search engine of said application stores to find the APPS they want and proceed to download them to their device. The download can also be accessed through the links available on the Website that redirect to the aforementioned application stores.</p>
    <p>Once the application has been downloaded, upon first launch of the APP, users may, at their discretion, provide general information relevant to the selected application, including but not limited to age range, gender, and areas of interest. This information may be updated or modified at any time through the configuration panel available within the APP.</p>
    <p>Users shall also have the option to enable or disable notifications and to configure the frequency with which content is delivered to their mobile device.</p>
    <p>Following the completion of the onboarding process, users will be granted access to a complimentary version of the APP containing limited functionality. This version is provided solely for the purpose of allowing users to evaluate the APP and determine whether it meets their individual needs and expectations.</p>
    <p>Should users wish to gain full access to all features and content offered by the APP, they may elect to subscribe to a Premium version. Subscription options include various paid plans (e.g., monthly or annual), and payment may be made using multiple accepted methods, including credit card or other supported online payment systems. All transactions shall be processed through the Google Play Store or the Apple App Store, depending on the platform from which the APP was originally downloaded.</p>
    <p>Therefore, the USER must be familiar with the terms and conditions of contract that each of the aforementioned download platforms makes available in the following links:</p>
    <p>Google Play Store (https://play.google.com/intl/es-419_es/about/play-terms/index.html)</p>
    <p>App Store (https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/es/terms.html)</p>
    <p>As well as the terms and conditions of the payment options offered by each of these app stores:</p>
    <p>Google Play Store via Google Pay/Google Payments service: (https://payments.google.com/payments/apis-secure/get_legal_document?ldo=0&amp;ldt=buyertos&amp;ldr=es and https://payments.google.com/payments/apis-secure/get_legal_document?ldo=0&amp;ldt=privacynotice).</p>
    <p>App Store via Apple Pay: (https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/es/terms.html.).</p>

    <h2>Price and period of validity of the offer</h2>
    <p>公司名称 will inform the USER prior to contracting the service, through the virtual store and in the APPS themselves, the price of the available SERVICES as well as whether the amount corresponding to tax that should be applied to said price.</p>
    <p>These prices, unless expressly stated otherwise, do not include communication costs, or any other additional and ancillary services to the service purchased.</p>
    <p>The prices applicable to each service are those published in the APPS and will be expressed in EURO and/or DOLLAR currency.</p>
    <p>The USER assumes that the economic valuation of some of the SERVICES may vary in real time without affecting those services already contracted.</p>
    <p>Before making your purchase, you will be able to check online all the details of the quotation: services, quantities, price, charges, discounts, taxes, and the total amount of the purchase. Prices may change daily until the order is placed.</p>

    <h3>7.1 Choice of service</h3>
    <p>In the event that the USER has opted for paid services, they may choose the plan that best suits their needs and, for this purpose, they may choose from the following plans offered by 公司名称 through its APPS:</p>
    <p>- Monthly payment</p>
    <p>- Annual payment</p>

    <h3>7.2 Payment methods and security</h3>
    <p>The USER may pay for their order using any of the options offered by the app stores (credit or debit card, PayPal, etc.). Accordingly, we do not have access to any payment information and therefore do not store such information.</p>
    <p>The terms and conditions of the payment options offered by Google Play Store through the Google Pay/Google Payments service are governed by the following terms of service (https://payments.google.com/payments/apis-secure/get_legal_document?ldo=0&amp;ldt=buyertos&amp;ldr=es) and privacy (https://payments.google.com/payments/apis-secure/get_legal_document?ldo=0&amp;ldt=privacynotice).</p>
    <p>The terms and conditions of the payment options offered by the App Store through the Apple Pay service are governed by the following terms and conditions of service and privacy https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/es/terms.html.</p>

    <h3>7.3 Applicable taxes</h3>
    <p>All prices offered will be final prices, however, they may vary from time to time, depending on the offers and/or discounts associated with each service. Where appropriate, the USER will be duly informed of any alteration in the price that may exist, and always prior to contracting.</p>
    <p>Unless a different amount is specified at the time of contracting, the total price for each of the types of service contracted may vary depending on the tax applicable to the USER purchaser, the purchaser being understood to be the natural person who acquires or contracts any of the services through the 公司名称 APPS.</p>
    <p>For the accrual of the taxes to be applied, the domicile or habitual residence of the recipient of the electronic service provision shall be considered.</p>
    <p>公司名称 informs the USER that at all times and prior to contracting the service, they will be informed through the platform about the amount corresponding to said tax, if applicable, and that this will be reflected in the contracting summary and/or particular conditions that will be sent to them.</p>

    <h3>7.4 Price changes</h3>
    <p>The USER is informed that 公司名称 reserves the right to modify prices at any time.</p>
    <p>When you purchase a subscription, you will initially be charged the rate that applies at the time you choose to subscribe. In the event that the subscription price increases at a later date, 公司名称 will notify you. This increase will be applied to the next payment due after you have received notice, provided that you have given at least 30 days' notice before the charge is applied. If less than 30 days' notice is given, the price increase will be applied to the next payment after the next payment due.</p>
    <p>If you do not wish to take up the price increase for a subscription, you may cancel your subscription by following the procedure described in the Cancellations section of these Terms; no further charges will apply to you, provided that you notify us of the cancellation before the end of the current billing period. If you cancel and decide to re-subscribe at a later date, you will be charged the price in effect at the time you re-subscribe.</p>

    <h3>7.5 Invoicing</h3>
    <p>Once the payment has been effectively made, the corresponding invoice or proof of purchase will be issued, which will contain the information corresponding to the service that the USER has contracted.</p>
    <p>Any payment made to Monkey Taps entails the issuance of an invoice in the name of the USER that the USER has informed at the time of placing the order. This invoice will be sent in PDF to the email address provided by the USER, as long as they have given their express consent to do so, informing them that they may revoke this consent at any time by notifying 公司名称 by any of the means made available to them.</p>
    <p>Likewise, the USER will be able to access the receipts and purchase history and purchase details in each of the app stores. To access it you can find out how to do it in the following links:</p>
    <p>-</p>

    <h2>Duration of service</h2>
    <p>The duration of the service will always be for the period selected by the USER and will also be paid according to the form and modality chosen.</p>
    <p>By subscribing, the USER obtains access to the content of the SERVICES on an ongoing basis, unless the USER cancels the subscription. Subscriptions are automatically charged at the beginning of each billing period (monthly or annual). In all cases the charge will be made no more than 24 hours before the start of each billing period.</p>
    <p>Trial period. When you subscribe to paid content you may be given a three-day trial period to enjoy the benefits of the subscription at no charge. After that time, you will be charged for the subscription until you cancel it and, to avoid such charges, you must cancel the subscription before the end of the trial period. Once the trial period is cancelled, you will immediately lose access to the content and privileges of the subscription.</p>
    <p>Cancellations. A subscription may be cancelled at any time during the applicable billing period. The cancellation will be applied and become effective as of the next billing period. For example, if you purchase a monthly subscription, you may cancel it during any month, at any time. The cancellation of the subscription will be effective at the end of the then-current billing period.</p>

    <h2>Right of withdrawal</h2>
    <p>Current legislation grants USERS an automatic right of withdrawal from contracts for the purchase and/or subscription to digital content. However, the services provided by 公司名称 begin their full execution from the moment the USER makes the payment through the chosen app store and automatically accesses the content of the SERVICES; therefore, it is not possible to apply said right of withdrawal. In this sense, the USER accepts the aforementioned regarding the right of withdrawal.</p>

    <h2>Force majeure</h2>
    <p>The parties shall not be liable for any failure due to force majeure. Performance of the obligation shall be delayed until the cessation of the force majeure.</p>
